### 🧠 Project Overview

This full-stack data science application tackles a major challenge in e-commerce — **efficient and accurate validation of customer return requests**.
Manual checking is slow and prone to human bias. Our **AI-powered assistant** automates this process through a **multimodal analysis** — combining insights from both **customer complaints** and **product images**.

The system provides **instant, evidence-based recommendations** — **Approve**, **Review**, or **Reject** — helping teams detect potential fraud and handle returns faster.
